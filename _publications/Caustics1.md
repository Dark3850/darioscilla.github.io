title: "Computer Vision Corrections Enhance UAV-Based Retrievals in Shallow Waters"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: #/publication/Caustics1
excerpt: 'The paper tackles a very practical problem in coastal remote sensing: shallow-water UAV images are degraded by sun glint and moving caustics, which lowers contrast and confuses downstream retrievals. Using flights from a DJI Mavic 2 Pro with a Hasselblad L1D-20c camera, the authors evaluate a lightweight pre-processing pipeline built from standard computer-vision steps such as color transfer or illumination normalization and simple multi-image averaging to suppress temporally varying flicker. In controlled tests, these corrections sharpen boundaries, improve tonal consistency, and raise basic image-quality metrics, which in turn boosts the performance of mapping and retrieval tasks compared with using raw frames only. The workflow is inexpensive, camera agnostic, and designed to be deployed quickly in the field, so it is a strong fit for survey teams that need better seabed visibility without heavy equipment or complex physics-based modeling.'
